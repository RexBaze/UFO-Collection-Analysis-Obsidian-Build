## Specifications

type:: Electro-optical / infrared targeting pod (Navy)
host_platform:: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F/A-18C/D legacy Hornet
manufacturer:: Raytheon

## Detection characteristics

Air-to-air and air-to-ground EO/IR with high zoom. The pod has Block I and Block II variants with different sensor resolutions. ATFLIR Block II is the source of the well-known 2004 USS Nimitz "Tic Tac" video and many subsequent Navy UAP recordings.

ATFLIR autotrack is a common field on the Navy Range Fouler Debrief Form. When the autotrack box is NOT checked, the pilot was manually maintaining track, which is a limitation for sustained observation.

## Notes

The visual style of ATFLIR imagery (white-hot or black-hot polarity, crosshair reticle, scale hash marks, target designation indicator) is the dominant aesthetic of the [[FBI Photo Series Index|FBI Photo series]] in this collection, suggesting most or all of those frames are Navy ATFLIR origin.
