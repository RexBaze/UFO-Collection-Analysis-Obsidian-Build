## Notes

AFCENT is the USAF air component of USCENTCOM, not a squadron. It appears in the record as the tasking MAJCOM for ISR missions whose specific reporting squadron is redacted (e.g. the 2020 Arabian Gulf D3 4-UAP observation). Where an incident lists "AFCENT" as the unit, treat it as the command echelon, the actual flying squadron is unstated in the released document.
