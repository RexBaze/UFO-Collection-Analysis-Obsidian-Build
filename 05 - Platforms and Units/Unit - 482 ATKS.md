## Notes

This unit is the reporting squadron for the cluster of 2020 Persian Gulf / Strait of Hormuz / Gulf of Oman ISR observations (D60-D65). Mission narratives describe long-endurance sorties (one mission ran ~21 hours), MX-class EO/IR sensor (ANDAS4) and AH/GMESH avionics, and explicit tasking to monitor Iranian unmanned aerial system (UAS) and IRGC-N / IRINS naval activity. The "ATKS" designator and the unmanned, long-endurance sensor fit point to an MQ-9 Reaper attack squadron rather than a crewed platform.

Designation and home station are inferred; the released documents redact most unit identifying detail. Confirm against the source PDFs when available.
