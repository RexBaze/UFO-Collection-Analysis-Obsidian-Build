# UFO / UAP Collection Analysis — Obsidian Vault

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) knowledge vault that structures, cross-references, and analyzes a collection of **publicly released and declassified U.S. government documents** on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP / "UFOs").

It turns a pile of source PDFs — DoD/DOW mission reports, State Department cables, CIA cables, FBI case files, NASA debriefings, and historical service studies — into a navigable network of incidents, sources, locations, platforms, sensors, witnesses, observed phenomenology, and cross-cutting analytical theses.

> [!NOTE]
> **What this is and isn't.** This is a *research and organization* project built on publicly available, officially released material. Cataloging a reported event or reproducing a document's original classification marking (e.g. "SECRET//NOFORN") is a statement about the **source record**, not a claim that any phenomenon is extraterrestrial or that any conclusion is established fact. Analytical hypotheses live in `09 - Patterns and Theses` and are explicitly labeled as hypotheses. Treat everything here as structured notes for study, not as settled truth.

## Getting started

### 1. Open the vault in Obsidian
Clone or download this repository, then in Obsidian choose **Open folder as vault** and point it at the repository root.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rex-Dev66/UFO-Collection-Analysis-Obsidian-Build.git
```

### 2. Install the Dataview plugin (required for live tables)
Many navigation pages (`Home`, the MOCs) use live [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) queries. Without the plugin you'll see raw `TABLE ... FROM ...` code instead of rendered tables.

1. **Settings → Community plugins → Turn on community plugins**
2. **Browse → search "Dataview"** (by Michael Brenan) → **Install → Enable**

### 3. (Optional) Templater + Canvas
- **Templater** (by SilentVoid13) auto-populates dates and prompts for fields when creating notes from the templates in `01 - Conventions and Templates`. The templates also work as plain Markdown without it.
- **Canvas** is a built-in core plugin — verify it's enabled to view the `.canvas` relationship maps in `09 - Patterns and Theses/Canvas`.

A full walkthrough — including suggested graph-view color groups — is in [`SETUP FIRST.md`](SETUP%20FIRST.md).

### 4. Start navigating
Open [`Home.md`](Home.md) for the main hub, then explore the Maps of Content:

- **MOC - Incidents by Year** — chronological index
- **MOC - Incidents by Location** — geographic index
- **MOC - Platforms and Units** — by aircraft / unit
- **MOC - Sources** — by source document
- **MOC - Patterns and Theses** — analytical hypotheses

## How the vault is organized

The single source of truth for structure is [`01 - Conventions and Templates/Vault Conventions.md`](01%20-%20Conventions%20and%20Templates/Vault%20Conventions.md). Highlights:

### Naming
Plain title case with a note-type prefix; structured dates go in frontmatter, not filenames.
- ✅ `Incident - 2023-02-21 Shaddadi F-15E`
- ✅ `Source - DOW-UAP-D19 Syria February 2023`

### Frontmatter
Every note carries YAML frontmatter. Common keys include `type` and `tags`, and — for incidents — `status`, `aor`, `date_event`, and `release_date`; sources add `mdr_number`. These fields power the Dataview tables. (Note creation/modification dates are handled automatically by Obsidian, so they aren't duplicated in frontmatter.)

### Incident status taxonomy
`unresolved` · `probable-conventional` · `assessed-conventional` · `inconclusive`

### Controlled tag vocabulary
Tags are namespaced and drawn from a fixed list (no ad-hoc tags):
- **Agency** — `#agency/dow`, `#agency/dod`, `#agency/cia`, `#agency/fbi`, `#agency/nasa`, `#agency/state`, `#agency/aaro`, …
- **AOR** — `#aor/centcom`, `#aor/indopacom`, `#aor/eucom`, `#aor/northcom`, …
- **Platform** — `#platform/f-15e`, `#platform/f-a-18`, `#platform/p-8a`, `#platform/apollo-csm`, …
- **Phenomenology** — `#phenom/orb`, `#phenom/white-hot`, `#phenom/disc`, `#phenom/no-radar-return`, …

### Templates
`01 - Conventions and Templates` contains a template for every note type (Incident, Source, Location, Platform, Unit, Sensor, Witness, Thesis) so new entries stay consistent.

## About the source material

Source documents come from the rolling **PURSUE / WAR.GOV/UFO** public-release program (Releases 01–03, May–June 2026) and earlier declassification tranches, routed through the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (**AARO**). The collection spans:

- **DOW / DoD** mission reports, range-fouler debriefs, and correspondence
- **State Department** diplomatic cables
- **CIA** UFO-series cables and the 1953 Robertson Panel material
- **FBI** domestic case files and witness interviews
- **NASA** Gemini/Apollo crew debriefings and visual materials
- **Historical service studies** (Army/Navy/USAF, 1948–1953)

Geographically the corpus is CENTCOM-heavy (~70%), with INDOPACOM, EUCOM/Mediterranean, and a historical/domestic remainder. See [`01 - Conventions and Templates/Collection Overview.md`](01%20-%20Conventions%20and%20Templates/Collection%20Overview.md) and `99 - Reference/Release Authorities` for full provenance.

> The raw source PDFs and images are **not** included in this repository — this vault holds the analytical layer (structured notes and cross-references) built on top of them.

## Contributing / extending

If you fork this to add your own notes:

1. Read `Vault Conventions.md` first.
2. Use the matching template from `01 - Conventions and Templates`.
3. Reuse existing tags from the controlled vocabulary — add new ones to the conventions note *before* using them, so the graph and Dataview queries stay coherent.
4. Keep one event per incident note and one document per source note.
