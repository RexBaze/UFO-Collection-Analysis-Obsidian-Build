> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note is the single source of truth for how the vault is organized. If a convention is not written here, it is not a convention. Edit this note when you change anything structural.

## Note naming

Use plain title case with spaces. Avoid leading dates in filenames; put structured dates in frontmatter instead. Examples:

- ✅ `Incident - 2023-02-21 Shaddadi F-15E`
- ✅ `Source - DOW-UAP-D19 Syria February 2023`
- ❌ `2023-02-21_Shaddadi.md`

Note-type prefixes keep folders scannable: `Incident -`, `Source -`, `Location -`, `Platform -`, `Unit -`, `Sensor -`, `Witness -`, `Phenom -`, `Thesis -`, `MOC -`.

## Folder discipline

| Folder | Holds | Naming prefix |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- |
| `02 - Incidents` | One note per observation event | `Incident -` |
| `03 - Sources` | One note per source PDF | `Source -` |
| `04 - Locations` | Geographic entities | `Location -` |
| `05 - Platforms and Units` | Aircraft + units | `Platform -` or `Unit -` |
| `06 - Sensors and Equipment` | Sensors, radars, pods, weapons | `Sensor -` |
| `07 - Witnesses` | Named or categorical witnesses | `Witness -` |
| `08 - Phenomenology` | Observed signatures and behaviors | `Phenom -` |
| `09 - Patterns and Theses` | Cross-cutting hypotheses | `Thesis -` |

## Frontmatter standards

Every note has YAML frontmatter. Common keys:

| Key | Used by | Values |
| --- | ------- | ------ |
| `title` | All | Title as it appears in graph |
| `date` | All | YYYY-MM-DD when note created |
| `tags` | All | Lowercase, hyphenated, from controlled vocabulary |
| `type` | All | `incident`, `source`, `location`, `platform`, `unit`, `sensor`, `witness`, `phenom`, `thesis`, `moc`, `reference` |
| `status` | Incidents | `unresolved`, `probable-conventional`, `assessed-conventional`, `inconclusive` |
| `aor` | Incidents | `centcom`, `indopacom`, `eucom`, `africom`, `northcom`, `southcom`, `space`, `na` |
| `date_event` | Incidents | YYYY-MM-DD of event itself |
| `release_date` | Sources, Incidents | YYYY-MM-DD of declassification |
| `mdr_number` | Sources | e.g., `MDR 25-0094 thru 25-0099` |

## Controlled tag vocabulary

> [!WARNING]
> Do not invent ad-hoc tags. Add new tags to this list first, then use them. This is how the graph and Dataview stay useful.

## Linking discipline

Every incident note links to: its location, its platform, its unit, its sensor(s), any witness(es), its source document(s), and any pattern(s) it supports or refutes.

Use `[[wikilinks]]` exclusively. Use display text only when the link target name does not read naturally in the sentence: `[[Location - Muwaffaq Salti Air Base|OJMS]]`.

When an entity has multiple common names, set aliases in its frontmatter:

```yaml
aliases: [OJMS, Muwaffaq Salti, Azraq]
```

## Dataview conventions

When you write an inline Dataview field for an incident, use these key names so the queries in the MOCs work:

```
date_event:: 2023-02-21
time_z:: 0025
aor:: centcom
country:: Syria
location:: [[Location - Shaddadi]]
mgrs:: 
platform:: [[Platform - F-15E Strike Eagle]]
unit:: [[Unit - 389 EFS]]
objects_count:: 3
shape:: round
color:: white
speed_kts:: 
altitude_ft:: 24000
duration_seconds:: 
radar_return:: no
iff_response:: no
weather:: cloudy
source:: [[Source - DOW-UAP-D19 Syria February 2023]]
status:: unresolved
```

## Update cadence

- [ ] Review this conventions note every time you add a new tag, folder, or template
- [ ] Audit the tag list quarterly to merge duplicates
