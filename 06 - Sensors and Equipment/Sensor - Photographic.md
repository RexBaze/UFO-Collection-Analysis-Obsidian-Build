## Detection characteristics

Handheld photography is the only "instrument" capture in the tranche 3 domestic cases, and it is a weak one. Night sightings were shot at long exposure without a tripod, producing blurred, smeared light blobs. This is important for assessment: long-exposure motion blur and out-of-focus point sources can manufacture "orb"-like artifacts, so photographic stills from these cases corroborate that *something luminous* was present but rarely resolve its shape, size, or distance. No calibrated radar, EO/IR, or ADS-B-correlated imagery accompanies the domestic orb cases.
