## Geography

country:: International waters (bordered by Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq)
region:: Middle East
aor:: centcom
coordinates:: ~26-30 N, 49-57 E
mgrs_zone:: 34S, 35S, 39R, 39S, 40R, 40S

## Significance

The Arabian Gulf is the single highest-density UAP reporting region in this collection. It hosts persistent U.S. Navy carrier presence (Fifth Fleet headquartered in Bahrain), continuous ISR coverage, U.S. Air Force operations from Al Udeid (Qatar), Al Dhafra (UAE), and multiple coalition partner operations. It is also adjacent to Iranian operating areas including the IRGC Navy.

Bottom line: high ISR density plus active foreign UAS development plus narrow strategic waterway equals an environment ==maximally biased toward UAP reporting==, independent of UAP density.
