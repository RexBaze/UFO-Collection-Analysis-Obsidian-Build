## Specifications

type:: Unaided human visual observation
host_platform:: Any platform with a window

## Detection characteristics

Most reliable for stable, well-lit, high-contrast targets at known ranges. Least reliable for brief, low-contrast, unknown-range events. Subject to all standard eyewitness reliability constraints documented in the cognitive psychology and aviation safety literature.

When visual observation is the only sensor (no radar, no EO/IR record), an observation can only be classified as "unresolved." It cannot be elevated to "anomalous" by pilot credibility alone, no matter how well-trained the pilot.
