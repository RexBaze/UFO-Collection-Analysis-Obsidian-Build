## Significance

Active conflict zone since 2011. Multiple foreign air forces operate in or over Syrian airspace: Russian, Turkish, Israeli, US/coalition (OIR), Syrian government, occasional Iranian. Eastern Syria (around [[Location - Shaddadi]]) is the main U.S. operating area. The skies are dense with conventional aircraft, drones, and surveillance balloons; attribution of any observation is challenging.
