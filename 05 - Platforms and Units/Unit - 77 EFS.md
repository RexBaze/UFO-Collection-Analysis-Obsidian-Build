## Notes

Reporting unit for the 2020-10-27 Range Fouler incident in which an F-16 obtained a stable radar lock and target-pod video on two IR-significant objects, one circling the other, and received active noise jamming before the objects disappeared in 1/30 second. The DCA mission profile, AWACS-directed intercept (KINGPIN), and target-pod employment are all consistent with an F-16 fighter squadron.

Squadron number and deployment location are inferred from the report's "77 EFS" designator; specific basing is redacted.
