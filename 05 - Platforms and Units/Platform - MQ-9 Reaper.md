## Notes

The MQ-9 is the most common ISR observer in the CENTCOM UAP corpus. Its EO/IR turret streams full-motion video exploited by a Distributed Ground Station (DGS), so UAP observations from this platform are screener-mediated rather than direct eyewitness. Long loiter time plus continuous FMV means transient objects (birds, balloons, small UAS, debris) frequently cross the field of view, which is reflected in the high rate of "possible bird" and "possible balloon" attributions in Reaper-originated reports.
