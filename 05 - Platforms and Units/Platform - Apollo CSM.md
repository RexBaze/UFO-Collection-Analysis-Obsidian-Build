## Notes

Observation environment is unique: vacuum, no atmospheric scattering, deep black sky, no atmospheric refraction. Visual phenomena that look anomalous to terrestrial intuition (cosmic ray phosphenes, debris field illumination, lunar surface flashes from meteoroid impacts) are routine in this environment.
