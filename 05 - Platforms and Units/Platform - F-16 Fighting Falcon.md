## Notes

In the 2020-10-27 Range Fouler incident, an F-16 from [[Unit - 77 EFS]] obtained a stable radar trackfile and targeting-pod video on two objects and received active noise jamming (indicated by two chevrons on the radar display) before the objects disappeared within a single video frame. The case illustrates the F-16's relevant sensor suite for UAP work: a fire-control radar that registers electronic attack, plus a targeting pod that records IR-significant contacts.

Platform attribution in that incident is inferred from the 77 EFS DCA tasking; the report itself redacts the airframe.
