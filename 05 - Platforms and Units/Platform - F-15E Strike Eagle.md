## Notes

F-15E radar (APG-82 AESA) is high resolution but EO/IR primary visual identification is via the Sniper-SE pod. The aircraft is two-seat (pilot and weapons systems officer), which provides two trained observers per aircraft per sortie. The 2-ship standard formation provides 4 sets of trained eyes plus 2 sensor packages on any given DCA mission.
