## Notes

MH-60R routinely operates at low altitudes over water in maritime surveillance roles, which gives it a perspective on low-altitude air contacts that fast movers miss. Range Fouler reports from MH-60R squadrons can capture small slow contacts that would not be of interest to fighter or AWACS sensor pipelines.
