## Notes

Ground observer reports are subject to all known eyewitness reliability constraints: distance and altitude estimation errors, duration overestimation for brief events, shape interpretation biases, and post-event memory consolidation effects. Documented witness disagreement (as in the LiDAR Convoy 2023 incident, where two witnesses gave materially different descriptions) is normal, not exceptional.
