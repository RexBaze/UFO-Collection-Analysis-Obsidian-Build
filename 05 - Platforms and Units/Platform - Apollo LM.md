## Notes

The LM appears in the NASA transcripts alongside the [[Platform - Apollo CSM]]. On Apollo 12, LMP Alan Bean's "particles of light" report was made looking out the LM Alignment Optical Telescope (AOT) in the dark quadrant, and a tracking-light visibility discrepancy resolved to an observation issue rather than a hardware failure. Most LM-associated observations in this collection were identified in real time by the crew or Capcom.
